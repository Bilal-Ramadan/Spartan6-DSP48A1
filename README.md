Introduction:

The Spartan-6 family offers a high ratio of DSP48A1 slices to logic, making it ideal for math-intensive applications. DSP48A1 is a Digital Signal Processing unit which does various Arithmetic and logic operations on digital signals up to 48 bits e.g adding, subtracting, AND, OR, multiplication,...etc.

In this Project, I implemented the DSP48A1 in Verilog hardware description language, and its testbench too. The simulation is on Questasim and the implemintation is on Xilinix Vivado.
